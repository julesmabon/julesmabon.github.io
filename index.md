About
====================

<img src="img/me.png" alt="drawing" width="180px"/>

I am a PhD student at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis in France. I am studying _CNN and Stochastic Geometry models for Multiple Object Detection in remote sensing Data Sets_ with Josiane Zerubia as my supervisor in partnership with Marthias Ortner from Airbus Defense and Space.
Currently secretary of the lovely [ADSTIC](https://adstic.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/) (_Association Doctorale du Campus STIC_).
I graduated in 2019 from Ecole Centrale de Lille (France) in Computer Science/Machine Learning.

I also sometimes make art that may end up in the [**creative projects** section](/crea/).
