About
====================

<img src="img/me.png" alt="drawing" width="180px"/>

I am a PhD student at Inria Sophia-Antipolis in France. I am finishing my PhD with [Josiane Zerubia](https://team.inria.fr/ayana/josiane-zerubia/) as my supervisor in partnership with Marthias Ortner from Airbus Defense and Space: _Learning Stochastic geometry models and convolutional neural networks. Application to multiple object detection in high resolution data sets._

Formerly secretary of the lovely [ADSTIC](https://adstic.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/) (_Association Doctorale du Campus STIC_) (2022-2023).
I graduated in 2019 from Ecole Centrale de Lille (France) as an engineer with specialization in Computer Science/Machine Learning.

I also sometimes make art that may end up in the [**creative projects** section](/crea/).
